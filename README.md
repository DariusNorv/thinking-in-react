# Thinking in React workshopper

This is going to be a [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) module based on [thinking in react](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).  
It will hopefully help you get started with [reactjs](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) and help you to get a good workflow from the get-go.
